Hi, Iâ€™m Sabrina!ðŸ‘‹ 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in code and fitness - both keep pushing me out of my comfort zone and allow me to expand my capabilities.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in Python with help of a Software Engineer Bootcamp through HyperionDev.


âš¡ Fun fact: 
 - I can speak 4 languages: English, German, Punjabi and Hindi
