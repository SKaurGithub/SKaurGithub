# Hi there, I’m Sabrina!👋 

Hi, I'm Sabrina, a Software Engineer.
- 👀 I’m interested in code and fitness - both keep pushing me out of my comfort zone and allow me to expand my capabilities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in Python with help of a Software Engineer Bootcamp through HyperionDev.
- 🤓 I also have some experience with SQL (more practice needed though)
- 📔 I'm getting more and more confident with Version Control and Git

###⚡ Fun fact: 
 - I can speak 4 languages: English, German, Punjabi and Hindi
